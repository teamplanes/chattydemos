## Chatty Demos

This repo holds 2 demos of applied AI in simple use-cases.

1. The first is 'ChattyFields' which is an example of a conversational form, it has a pirate tone of voice (of course) and will continue to ask you questions until it has all of the pieces of info it needs.
2. The second is 'ChattySplit' which is a simple expense tracker that enables users to enter their expenses using natural language. The benefit of using GPT in this case to so that the tool does the reasoning/logic. This is also a simple example of how you can effectively use GPT for purely reasoning and then to do the maths yourself.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
